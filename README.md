======================

Vacation / Out of Office plugin for Roundcube.

About
-----
This is a rewrite of the Vacation plugin for Roundcube.
It is currently not working as I haven't completed (re)writing it.

I've starting with writing the plugin for virtual/mysql (postfixadmin) support.
After this is done, I'll start by looking at the other drivers.

More instructions will be available once the virtual driver and UI is working and completed.


Todo

Almost everything.
